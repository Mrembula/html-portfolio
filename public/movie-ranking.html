<h1>The Best Movies According to Tebogo</h1>

<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Wolf of Wallstreet</h3>
<p>Simple, Leonardo DiCaprio  bought this character to life. Amazing movie</p>

<h3>Inglorious Bastard</h3>
<p>The best director for me. The way it started to the end, even the villian did an amazing job on this</p>

<h3>The TENANT</h3>
<p>Fun fact. You can watch this movie backward</p>
